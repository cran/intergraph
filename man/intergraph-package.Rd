\title{Coercion routines for network data objects in R}
\description{
This package contains methods for coercion between various
classes used to represent network data in \R.
}
\details{
Functions implemented in this package allow to coerce (i.e., convert) network
data between classes provided by other R packages. Currently supported packages
are: \pkg{network}, \pkg{igraph} (versions prior to 0.6, see Note below).

The main functions are:
\itemize{
  \item \code{as.network} and its method \code{\link{as.network.igraph}} to
  create objects of class "network".

  \item \code{\link{as.igraph}} and its methods to create objects of class "igraph".
}
See their help pages for more information and examples.

As all the supported packages are written using S3 methods, so are the methods
in this package. This may change in the future.

If you find this package useful in your work please cite it. Type
\code{citation(package="intergraph")} for the information how to do that.
}
\note{
  In June 2012 a new version 0.6 of \pkg{igraph} was released which is not
  backward-compatibile. The legacy version is renamed to \pkg{igraph0}.  This
  version of package \pkg{intergraph} (1.2-x) relies on the legacy
  \pkg{igraph0}.

  The next version of \pkg{intergraph} (1.3-x) will be compatible with
  the new API of \pkg{igraph} (0.6 or later).

\examples{
# example of converting objects between classes 'network' and 'igraph'

if( require(network) & require(igraph0) )
{

  ### convert 'network' -> 'igraph'

  # example network
  summary(exNetwork)

  # convert to igraph
  g <- as.igraph(exNetwork)

  # check if 'exNetwork' and 'g' are the same
  all.equal( as.matrix(exNetwork, "edgelist"), 
    igraph0::get.edgelist(g) + 1 )   
    # +1 because igraph's vertex ids start from 0

  # compre results using 'netcompare'
  netcompare(exNetwork, g)

  ### convert 'igraph' -> 'network'

  # example network: same as above but of class 'igraph'
  summary(exIgraph)

  # convert to network class
  gg <- as.network(exIgraph)

  # check if they are the same
  all.equal( get.edgelist(exIgraph), as.matrix(gg, "edgelist"))
  # compre results using 'netcompare'
  netcompare(exIgraph, g)
